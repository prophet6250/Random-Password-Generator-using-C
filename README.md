# Random-Password-Generator-using-C
This program generates a file called "pass.SAL" in the project root directory. The generated passwords will be 31 characters long by default, and that can be tweaked to make it longer and shorted too. Feel free to add more characters in the dictionary for pass_gen. Just make sure that character set is permitted on the service you're generating the password for.

Also, please make a copy of the file and then use the passcoded generated by this program. Else, if you accidentally re-run the program, the existing passcode file will be overwrited and new passcodes will be generated. So make sure to rename/backup the file somewhere else before doing anything with the passcodes.

Happy hacking :)
