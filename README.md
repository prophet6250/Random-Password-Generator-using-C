# Random-Password-Generator-using-C
This program generates a file called "pass.mp3" in the project root directory. The generated passwords will be 31 characters long by default, and that can be tweaked to make it longer and shorted too. Feel free to add more characters in the dictionary for pass_gen. Just make sure that character set is permitted on the service you're generating the password for.

Since you'll be wondering, "hey, .mp3 is for audio files, right?". Right. But i've made our passcode text file a .mp3 as a measure of extra protection, in case you're thinking of keeping this file in multiple devices. A text file, full of your passcodes? Sounds dangerous. An audio file full of your passcodes? sounds silly already... And that's the point :)

Open the dat.cp3 file using any text editor of your choice, whenever you want to. Don't try to play it using a audio player! Results are unknown but catastrophic!

Also, please make a copy of the file and then use the passcoded generated by this program. Else, if you accidentally re-run the program, the existing passcode file will be overwrited and new passcodes will be generated. So make sure to rename/backup the file somewhere else before doing anything with the passcodes.

Compile and run the program using GCC compiler. Anything above version 6 would do. Lower might also do, but I haven't tested this on those versions, so can't really say.

Happy hacking :)
